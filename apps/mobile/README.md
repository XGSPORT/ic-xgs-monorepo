# `mobile`

An example of mobile app that works using the authentication flow implemented in the SSP canister is available at [ilbertt/ic-react-native-jwt-auth/src/app](https://github.com/ilbertt/ic-react-native-jwt-auth/tree/a71522a234be91a4b3aa9eb0ddb5b012aa4ecb6f/src/app), and is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). You can copy that app and place it in this folder and use it as a starting point to develop your own mobile app.
